You MUST have the walton wallet installed to run this miner. (the private keys etc dont matter as you wont be mining to it)
You can find the offical wallet zip in the wpoolcpu folder (or at this link https://github.com/WaltonChain/WaltonWallet_Win_x64).

IMPORTANT: Make sure the walton wallet is closed before you run the easyminer. 

You can CPU mine without it affecting your GPU performance. In task manager, details tab, right click the task (walton.exe)
and hit 'set affinity, uncheck one of the cores.

The 'psuedo' pools address is:
